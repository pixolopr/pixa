# PIXA - ANIMATION IN YOUR CONTROL

### Pixa (Pixolo Animate) Library works along with the open Source CSS Library called Animate CSS. So you will need to download and import that into your project first.
### Get Animate CSS here: [Animate CSS](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/)

## How to use ?

### Step 1: Add `pixa` class to the Elements on which you want to use this Effect.
### Step 2: Add the animation class you want to use. Refer [Animate CSS](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) for class names
### Step 3: Write this line inside the script Tag `new PIXA().init();` after all the HTML Elements to initiate the Library

## Different Atributes that you can use directly inside an HTML Element

### `data-pixa-duration="2s"` - This will define the duration of the animation in seconds
### `data-pixa-delay="0s"` - This will define the delay after which the Animation will perform after it appears on the screen.
